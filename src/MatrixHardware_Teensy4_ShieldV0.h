// Hardware-specific header file for the SmartLED Shield for Teensy 4 (V0):
//    Only Teensy 4.0/4.1 models are supported.
//
// Some of the pin assignments can be changed using solderable jumpers on the adapter board:
// JP4:
//    Default: Pin 8 connected to BUFFER_CLK, Pin 7 free
//    Alt: Pin 7 connected to BUFFER_CLK, Pin 8 free
//      To use the alternate clock pin, in addition to soldering the jumper you must set flag SMARTMATRIX_OPTIONS_T4_CLK_PIN_ALT in kMatrixOptions
// JP2 & JP3:
//    Default: Pins 4 & 5 free, Pin 13 connected to APA_CLK, Pin 11 connected to APA_DAT (intended for APA102 driving via hardware SPI), LED Matrix not drivable at the same time
//    Alt: Pin 4 connected to APA_CLK, Pin 5 connected to APA_DAT (intended for APA102 driving via SPI emulation), LED Matrix is drivable at the same time

// Note: only one MatrixHardware_*.h file should be included per project

// Minimum tested working value is 20 (corresponding to 24 MHz clock frequency) on DP5020B panel
