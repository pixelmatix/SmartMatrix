// Hardware-specific header file to use the SmartLED Shield V4 with Teensy 4.0/4.1 without any adapter.
//   Other Teensy models are not supported. APA LED driving is not supported.
// The following hardware modifications are required:
// 1. Attach two wires to pins 32 and 33. For Teensy 4.0, this requires soldering to two of the pads on the
//    underside of the board. For Teensy 4.1, these pins are along the outer edges and are connected using header pins.
// 2. Insert the other ends of these two wires into the sockets in the SmartLED Shield to make the following connections:
//    2a. Connect pin 32 to pin 5.
//    2b. Connect pin 33 to pin 3.
// 3. Then make the following cross-connections using jumper wires inserted into the SmartLED Shield V4 sockets:
//    3a. Connect pin 10 to pin 14.
//    3b. Connect pin 12 to pin 2.
//    3c. Connect pin 11 to pin 20.
//    3d. Connect pin 9 to pin 21.
// Pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20, 21, 32, and 33 are not available for other functions.
